# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Overview

The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a Python-based tool designed to capture, analyze, and visualize network traffic for security monitoring and threat detection. This project uses Scapy for packet capturing and analysis, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visual reporting.

## Features

- **Packet Capture**: Captures network packets from a specified interface.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracts and processes key features such as source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol.
- **Visualization**: Generates visual reports to summarize and analyze network traffic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `scapy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scapy pandas matplotlib
